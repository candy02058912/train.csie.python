# 🚀 Python Playground

This repository contains various Python scripts. 

To make it easy to browse and run them, an automated index page is generated! You can view the list of scripts online.

## 🌐 View Online

Check out the scripts here: **[https://candy02058912.github.io/train.csie.python/](https://candy02058912.github.io/train.csie.python/)** *(Note: Replace with your actual GitHub Pages URL if different, assuming standard `username.github.io/repo` format)*

## 🛠️ How it works

The `index.html` file is automatically generated by the `build.py` script. The script scans the repository for all `.py` files and creates a beautiful, interactive index page linking to each script.

### Generating the Index Locally

If you add new Python files and want to update the `index.html` locally:

```bash
python3 build.py
```

## 🚀 Deployment

This project uses [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to automatically build the index and deploy to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. 
You don't need to manually run `build.py` and commit `index.html` - the CI/CD pipeline handles it!
